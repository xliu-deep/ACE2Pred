# ACE2Pred

Despite the fact that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been disrupting human life and health worldwide for several years, the interaction between exogenous substances and pathogens is not well understood. During viral infection, organism receptors play a significant role in mediating the entry of viruses into host cells. Taking angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major receptor of SARS-CoV-2, as an example, a deep learning model based on graph convolutional neural network (GCN) was constructed for the first time to predict how exogenous substances affect the transcriptional expression of the ACE2 gene in the study. Systematic analysis showed that the proposed GCN model outperformed other traditional machine learning models, and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) reached 0.712 and 0.703 on validation set and test set, respectively.
